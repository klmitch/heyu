Self-Notification Utility
=========================

HeyU is a utility, composed of 3 parts, for generating notifications
on one machine that can result in pop-ups on another.  It is, in
essence, a cross-machine ``notify-send`` command.

This is a personal project, but is published with the idea that it
could be helpful to other users.
